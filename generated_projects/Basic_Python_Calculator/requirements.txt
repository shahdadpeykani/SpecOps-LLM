# This project primarily uses Python's standard library (tkinter).
# No external pip installable packages are strictly required for the core application.
# If you plan to deploy as a standalone executable, tools like PyInstaller or fbs might be used,
# but they are build-time dependencies, not runtime dependencies for the code itself.

# Example for future additions:
# some_library==1.0.0
